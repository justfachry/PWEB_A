        <p>Gulai ikan patin or catfish curry is the traditional food in Riau that usually served when have dinner with family.
             Catfish curry is also served in wedding party or cultural event. The main ingredient is catfish that cooked with curry soup.
             I rarely eat these foods because I don't really like fish.
