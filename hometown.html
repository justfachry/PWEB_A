            My hometown is Duri. Duri is a little in City in Riau province.
             My hometown well-known as oil city because too many petrolium company and my hometown was built because of that.
             My hometown is not too big, there only 1 traditional market and 1 mall.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my hometown, there is large complex owned by CHEVRON Company.
            It is the large petrolium company in my hometown.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is many tribe in my hometown, such as Melayu, Minang, Jawa, Chinese, Batak, etc.
             Duri is still thick with Melayu culture, but the traditional language that using for colloquial language is Melayu and Minang.
             I am still confused that Minang language is more often than Melayu language in my city.
